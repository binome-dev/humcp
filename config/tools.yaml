# HuMCP Tool Configuration
#
# This file controls which tools are exposed as API endpoints.
#
# RULES:
#   1. Empty file or missing config = load ALL tools (default)
#   2. If `include` is specified, ONLY those categories/tools are loaded
#   3. Then `exclude` removes any matching categories/tools from the result
#
# WILDCARDS:
#   Tool names support glob patterns: *, ?, [seq], [!seq]
#   Examples:
#     - "shell_*"           matches all shell tools
#     - "calculator_*"      matches all calculator tools
#     - "google_sheets_*"   matches all Google Sheets tools
#
# AVAILABLE CATEGORIES:
#   - data     (CSV and pandas operations)
#   - files    (PDF conversion)
#   - google   (Google Workspace: Sheets, Docs, Drive, Gmail, Calendar, etc.)
#   - local    (Calculator, filesystem, shell)
#   - search   (Web search via Tavily)
#
# EXAMPLES:
#
# 1. Load ALL tools (default - just leave file empty or comment everything):
#    # (empty)
#
# 2. Load only specific categories:
#    include:
#      categories:
#        - local
#        - data
#
# 3. Load everything except Google tools:
#    exclude:
#      categories:
#        - google
#
# 4. Load local category but exclude shell tools:
#    include:
#      categories:
#        - local
#    exclude:
#      tools:
#        - shell_*
#
# 5. Load only specific tools:
#    include:
#      tools:
#        - calculator_add
#        - calculator_subtract
#        - filesystem_read_file
#
# 6. Complex filtering:
#    include:
#      categories:
#        - local
#        - data
#    exclude:
#      tools:
#        - shell_*
#        - query_csv_file
